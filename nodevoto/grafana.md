Linkerd provides some standard dashboards right out of the box. This provides a
great heads up view into the health of a service that can be used for monitoring
and a basis for alerting. To check these out, run:

`./expose-grafana.sh`

Then you can [open nodevoto](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9093-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)
and see what's going on in your browser.
